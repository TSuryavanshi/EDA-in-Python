# Data Science Practical

# Problem statement: 
Create your own dataset with minimum 20 values and perform the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

# Approach:
Data Science Pipiline for this Practical--> 

1. Import Libraries
2. Data Generation
3. Data Collection
5. Data Understanding
6. Data preprocessing (Cleaning refers to removal of unnecessary, duplicate data whereas preprocessing refers to cleaning as well as guessing the null values using statistical measures of central tendency, feature selection, data wrangling, etc)
7. EDA:
    - Variable analysis: (To understand the relationship between the variables and data withing these variables)<br>
       a. Univariate (We check how the observations within given (one) column relate to each other)<br>
       b. bivariate (Here, analysis of relationship between 2 variables is taken under consideration)<br>
       c. multi-variate analysis (Refers to the analysis of relationship between more than 2 variables)<br>
    - Visualization: Graphical representaion of data (Base plot-Histogram, statistical plots-Seaborn)
    - Correlation Analysis (Columns with too high (positive/negative) correlation need to be reduced. Omitting one of them based on thier correlation with other columns makes sense here as too many values leading to same outcome means unnecessary noise.)
  
### Difference between Variable analysis and correlation analysis:
Variable analysis is about understanding the columns, checking how two columns (or many) relate to each other. 
Correlation analysis is done to check the degree of closeness within these variables in order to remove the highly correlated data and check which data has lowest correlation meaning this data will add meaningful dimensions to the analysis.
